used to produce witnesses for an illegal flow, which do not necessarily represent a concrete
execution of the program. This bachelor thesis will provide a detailed approach to eliminate
these false witnesses using counterexample guided abstraction refinement (CEGAR) and
thereby increase precision.
As not all values satisfying the PC need to occur simultaneously during a program execution,
a property is introduced which is true iff the values occur during the program execution.
Some values are always occurring simultaneously if a flow exists. This information can be
used to increase precision and is added to the described property, without using temporal

SemSlice is based on automatic relational regression verification, which SemSlice uses to select valid slices from a set of candidate slices. We present several approaches for producing candidates for precise slices. Evaluation shows that regression verification (based on coupling invariant inference) is a powerful tool for semantics-aware slicing: precise slices for typical slicing challenges can be found automatically and fast.},

that addition of constraints should always cancel a variable and/or
that so-called saturation is used instead of division. It is known
that on CNF inputs cutting planes with cancelling addition and
saturation is essentially just resolution. We show that even if
general addition is allowed, this proof system is still polynomially
simulated by resolution with respect to proof size as long as
coefficients are polynomially bounded.
As a further way of delineating the proof power of subsystems of CP,
we propose to study a number of easy (but tricky) instances of
problems in NP. Most of the formulas we consider have short and simple
tree-like proofs in general CP, but the restricted subsystems seem to
reveal a much more varied landscape. Although we are not able to
formally establish separations between different subsystems of
CP---which would require major technical breakthroughs in proof
complexity---these formulas appear to be good candidates for obtaining
such separations. We believe that a closer study of these benchmarks

Extending this approach to pseudo-Boolean (PB) solvers doing 0-1 linear programming holds the promise of further exponential improvements in theory, but intriguingly such gains have not materialized in practice. Also intriguingly, most PB extensions of CDCL use not the division rule in cutting planes as defined in [Cook et al., '87] but instead the so-called saturation rule. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no study comparing the strengths of division and saturation in the context of conflict-driven PB learning, when all linear combinations of inequalities are required to cancel variables. We show that PB solvers with division instead of saturation can be exponentially stronger. In the other direction, we prove that simulating a single saturation step can require an exponential number of divisions. We also perform some experiments to see whether these phenomena can be observed in actual solvers. Our conclusion is that a careful combination of division and saturation seems to be crucial to harness more of the power of cutting planes.s},

Based on this, we propose a framework for precise and automatic program slicing. As part of this framework, we present three strategies for the generation of slice candidates, and we show how dynamic slicing approaches -- that interweave generating and checking slice candidates -- can be used for this purpose. The framework can easily be extended with other strategies for generating slice candidates. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of slicing approaches that use our framework.},

to sample solutions uniformly at random. Counting and uniform sampling
are fundamental problems in computer science with a wide range of
applications ranging from constrained random simulation, probabilistic
inference to network reliability and beyond. The past few years have
witnessed the rise of hashing-based approaches that use XORbased
hashing and employ SAT solvers to solve the resulting CNF formulas
conjuncted with XOR constraints. Since over 99\% of the runtime of
hashing-based techniques is spent inside the SAT queries, improving
CNF-XOR solvers has emerged as a key challenge.
In this paper, we identify the key performance bottlenecks in the
recently proposed BIRD architecture, and we focus on overcoming these
bottlenecks by accelerating the XOR handling within the SAT solver and
on improving the solver integration through a smarter use of (partial)
solutions. We integrate the resulting system, called BIRD2, with the
state of the art approximate model counter, ApproxMC3, and the state
of the art almost-uniform model sampler UniGen2. Through an extensive
evaluation over a large benchmark set of over 1896 instances, we
observe that BIRD2 leads to consistent speed up for both counting and
sampling, and in particular, we solve 77 and 51 more instances for
counting and sampling respectively.},

These advances,however, are achieved through highly sophisticated algorithms that aredifficult to verify and prone to implementation errors that can causeincorrect results. A promising approach to detect wrong results is touse certifying algorithms that produce not only the desired output butalso a certificate or proof of correctness of the output. An externaltool can then verify the proof to determine that the given answer isvalid. In the Boolean satisfiability (SAT) community, this concept iswell established in the form of proof logging, which has become thestandard solution for generating trustworthy outputs. The problem isthat there are still some SAT solving techniques for which prooflogging is challenging and not yet used in practice. Additionally,there are many formalisms more expressive than SAT, such as constraintprogramming, various graph problems and maximum satisfiability(MaxSAT), for which efficient proof logging is out of reach forstate-of-the-art techniques.This work develops a new proof system building on the cutting planesproof system and operating on pseudo-Boolean constraints (0-1 linearinequalities).
