## Publications

{% include publications.html %}


## Research Tools

* [VeriPB](https://github.com/StephanGocht/VeriPB), a tool for
  verifying refutations of pseudo-Boolean formulas (proofs of
  unsatisfiability) and more (such as verifying that a valid solution
  is found).


* [IncPlan](http://github.com/StephanGocht/incplan), a tool for SAT base planning
with incremental SAT solvers supporting the IPASIR interface.
