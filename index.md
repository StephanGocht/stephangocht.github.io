# About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="me.jpg">

Hi! I graduated with a PhD in computer science at Lund University in 2022.
Since then I am trying my luck with starting my own research heavy AI company.

# Interest

Broadly speaking, my interest covers a wide range of topics in AI, especially

* neuronal networks for CGI and image generation,
* SAT solving and integer linear programming,
* automated proof generation and verification,
* automated planning, and
* software analysis and verification.

# Publications

{% include publications.html %}


# Research Tools

* [VeriPB](https://gitlab.com/MIAOresearch/software/VeriPB), a tool for
  verifying refutations of pseudo-Boolean formulas (proofs of
  unsatisfiability) and more (such as verifying that a valid solution
  is found).


* [IncPlan](http://github.com/StephanGocht/incplan), a tool for SAT base planning
with incremental SAT solvers supporting the IPASIR interface.
